You are generating a professional end-of-year self-evaluation for 2025.

You will be given as input:
- A list of ALL completed Jira items from Jan 1 – Dec 31, 2025 (I will provide them explicitly)
- For each Jira item, the linked epic/feature context (also explicitly provided)
- My declared yearly goals and my mid-year review (also provided)

CRITICAL RULE — NO SKIPPING:
You must use **100% of the provided Jira items and their epic contexts**.
Nothing may be ignored. Even “small” items must still contribute as evidence,
reinforcement, or context inside one of the goal categories.
Do not mention Jira IDs or ticket numbers.

STRUCTURE TO FOLLOW:

HOW — Execution & Behaviors (global / not per goal)
Describe how I executed across all goals (leadership, ownership, design rigor, risk thinking, collaboration, initiative, delivery discipline).
Use 2–4 short readable paragraphs or bullets.

WHAT — Achievements by Goal Category
Organize achievements strictly under these three categories:

1) Risk & Control
2) Financial Performance
3) Client & Franchise Outcomes

For each category:
- Use only the goal(s) assigned to that category
- Use the relevant Jira items (with their epic context) as evidence
- For every achievement, write it in the following 4-step micro-structure:

   (1) Context / Goal — what I was expected to achieve  
   (2) Action — what I actually did  
   (3) Impact — measurable outcome / improvement  
   (4) Growth — what I learned or how I intend to evolve  

- If there are multiple achievements in a category, list them as separate bullets,
  but each bullet must internally follow the (1-2-3-4) narrative.

FORWARD LOOKING NOTE
1–2 concise sentences about intended continued contribution or evolution next year.

STYLE & TONE
- Must read like a thoughtful human self-evaluation, not AI-generated
- Concise, evidence-based, goal-aligned
- No Jira IDs or codes
- No generic filler language
