You are generating a professional end-of-year self-evaluation for 2025.

Inputs:
- All completed Jira items from January 1, 2025 to December 31, 2025
- Use the epics and linked features associated with each Jira item to understand context
- My declared yearly goals and mid-year review (implicitly included in your context)

Tasks:
1. For every goal, explicitly connect it to at least one concrete achievement from completed work this year.
2. Use the context of epics and linked features to provide **specific examples, evidence, or proof** of what was accomplished in relation to each goal.
3. WHAT section:
   - Describe the actual achievements in a clear, outcome-driven, goal-aligned way.
   - Include measurable results or concrete outcomes wherever possible.
   - **When there are multiple achievements, list them as bullet points for clarity.**
4. HOW section:
   - Describe how these results were accomplished — emphasizing behaviors, ownership, collaboration, design decisions, leadership, problem-solving, and impact on team and organization.
   - Use short, readable paragraphs; if there are multiple behaviors or approaches, separate them into bullets for clarity.
5. Avoid generic AI/robotic language — write as a human professional engineer self-reporting thoughtfully and credibly.
6. Do not mention Jira IDs, ticket numbers, or internal codes.
7. Structure output exactly as follows:

WHAT — End of Year Outcomes
- [Bullet 1: achievement + example/proof]
- [Bullet 2: achievement + example/proof]
- [...]

HOW — Execution & Behaviors
- [Paragraph 1: description of behaviors/approach]
- [Paragraph 2: description of behaviors/approach]
- [...]

Forward Looking Note
[1–2 concise sentences about continued contribution or next steps]

Output should be concise, readable, professional, and easy to scan.
Do not generate output until all Jira items and their contextual links have been considered.
When ready, respond only with: READY TO PROCESS
