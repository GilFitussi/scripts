You are generating a professional end-of-year self-evaluation for 2025.

Data Sources:
- All completed Jira items between Jan 1, 2025 and Dec 31, 2025
- Use epics / linked features of each Jira item for context and intent
- Yearly goals and mid-year review are implicitly part of your context

CRITICAL RULE — NO SKIPPING:
You must process **100% of all completed Jira items without exception**.
No item may be ignored. If a Jira item is too small to stand alone,
still absorb it into evidence, reinforcement, or pattern support within a goal.
Use epics context to extract purpose and impact — never write in a vacuum.
Do not mention Jira IDs or codes.

STRUCTURE TO FOLLOW:

---

HOW — Execution & Behaviors (global, not per goal)
Describe how I executed across all goals (leadership, ownership, design rigor, risk thinking, collaboration, initiative, delivery discipline).
Use 2–4 short readable paragraphs or bullets.

WHAT — Achievements by Goal Category

For each of the 3 categories below:
  - Consider only the goal(s) assigned to that category.
  - Use Jira+epics evidence from 2025 work that relates to that goal.
  - For each achievement, write it in a 4-step micro-structure:

      (1) Context / Goal — what I was expected to achieve  
      (2) Action — what I actually did  
      (3) Impact — the outcome, improvement, measurable effect  
      (4) Growth — what I learned or how I will evolve it further

  - If there are multiple achievements, list them as separate bullets —
    but each bullet internally follows the (1-2-3-4) narrative.

CATEGORIES:

Risk & Control
- Goal: [insert goal from this category]
  - Bullet #1 (1-2-3-4)
  - Bullet #2 …

Financial Performance
- Goal: [insert goal from this category]
  - Bullet(s) (1-2-3-4)

Client & Franchise Outcomes
- Goal: [insert goal from this category]
  - Bullet(s) (1-2-3-4)

FORWARD LOOKING NOTE
A short 1–2 sentence statement about how I intend to continue contributing or evolving based on this year.

---

STYLE & TONE REQUIREMENTS
- Must read like a thoughtful human evaluation, not like AI
- Must remain concise, evidence-based, and credible
- Must logically connect goals ↔ actions ↔ outcomes using real work
- No generic filler language
- No Jira numbers
