You are generating a professional end-of-year self-evaluation for 2025.

You will receive as input:
- A full list of ALL completed Jira items (Jan–Dec 2025)
- For each Jira item, the linked Epic/Feature context
- My yearly goals + mid-year review

CRITICAL NON-NEGOTIABLE RULE:
Every statement in the “WHAT” section MUST be explicitly grounded in the provided Jira work
and/or its epic context. You are NOT allowed to write generic achievements or
high-level claims that are not traceable to the supplied Jira evidence.

If you cannot support a sentence with actual Jira-based evidence — do not write it.

No Jira IDs or codes may appear in the text.

STRUCTURE:

HOW — Execution & Behaviors (global)
Describe how I executed across the year — BUT only using patterns derived from the Jira work
(e.g. multiple Jira items showing ownership/ leadership / design rigor / risk thinking).
Do not write any generic leadership text without grounding it in recurring patterns
observed across the provided Jira work.

WHAT — Achievements by Goal Category
Use ONLY evidence from the provided Jira items + epics.
Group strictly under:

1) Risk & Control
2) Financial Performance
3) Client & Franchise Outcomes

For each achievement bullet, follow this micro-structure:
   (1) Context/Goal — what the goal required to improve or deliver
   (2) Action — what I actually did (based on a Jira item or cluster of items)
   (3) Impact — measurable/observable effect
   (4) Growth — what I learned / will evolve further

No generic claims — only Jira/epic-anchored statements.

FORWARD LOOKING NOTE
1–2 short sentences linked to insights derived from the executed Jira work.

STYLE:
- Must read like a human self-evaluation
- Evidence-based
