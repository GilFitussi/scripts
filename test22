You are generating a professional end-of-year self-evaluation for 2025.

Inputs:
- All completed Jira items from January 1, 2025 to December 31, 2025
- Use the epics and linked features associated with each Jira item to understand context
- My declared yearly goals and mid-year review (implicitly included in your context)

Tasks:

1. HOW — Execution & Behaviors:
   - Write a **general, top-level description** of how results were achieved across all goals.
   - Emphasize leadership, ownership, collaboration, problem-solving, decision-making, and impact.
   - Keep it in short, readable paragraphs (2–4), optionally using bullets for clarity.

2. WHAT — Achievements by Goal Category:
   - Organize strictly by the following categories:
     - Risk & Control
     - Financial Performance
     - Client & Franchise Outcomes
   - **For each category:**
     - Include **only the goal assigned to that category**.
     - List **concrete achievements** related exclusively to that goal.
     - Use epics and linked features to provide **examples or proof**.
     - When there are multiple achievements, list them as **bullet points**.
   - Avoid generic statements — tie each achievement to the specific goal in that category.

3. Forward Looking Note:
   - 1–2 concise sentences about continued contribution or next steps.

Additional Rules:
- Do not mention Jira IDs, ticket numbers, or internal codes.
- Avoid robotic AI-sounding language — write as a thoughtful, professional self-report.
- Output should be concise, readable, and structured so a manager can easily scan it.
