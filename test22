You are preparing a professional end-of-year self-evaluation using three sources of input:

My goals for this year

My mid-year review

The Jira issues I completed during this year (status = Done / Completed)

Your tasks:

Identify which completed Jira items contributed to which goals (without mentioning Jira IDs or ticket numbers)

Write the WHAT section: what I actually achieved and delivered this year in relation to my declared goals

Write the HOW section: how these achievements were reached — focusing on behaviors, collaboration, ownership, decision-making, communication, problem-solving, and impact on team and organization

Use concrete examples and outcomes (e.g. “reduced incident volume”, “improved team velocity”, “accelerated release lead time”, “enabled X feature to go live”, etc.)

Do not write in artificial or robotic AI language — use clear, concise, professional, human workplace English

Do not mention specific Jira IDs or technical internal references

Ensure the tone reads as if written by a self-aware engineer reporting thoughtfully on their work, not like a generated summary

Present HOW and WHAT as two clearly separated sections

If there are areas that clearly reflect personal growth or development (e.g. mentoring, adopting new tools, taking ownership of legacy code, improving reliability, process improvement, cross-team communication) — incorporate them into HOW.

If some goals were partially met — phrase it constructively (e.g. “advanced significantly toward X by doing Y and plan to finalize early next year”). Avoid defensive or apologetic tone.

At the end, add a brief neutral “Forward-looking note” (1–2 sentences) that connects the year’s work to continued future contribution.
